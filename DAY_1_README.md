# Day 1: Chrome Extension with React & MetaMask - Setup Guide

## Overview
Welcome to Day 1 of the tutorial! Today we'll set up a Chrome extension development environment using Javascript and MetaMask integration. We'll be working with a proven boilerplate and setting up our local blockchain development tools.

## What We're Building
We're using the **chrome-extension-react-metamask-boilerplate** - a starter template that provides:
- Chrome extension structure with React
- Web3 integration for blockchain interaction
- MetaMask wallet login support
- Gulp-based build system for extension development
- CSS Modules support
- ESLint configuration

**Repository**: https://github.com/shaheem-khanzada/chrome-extension-react-metamask-boilerplate

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**
- **Chrome/Chromium browser** (for testing the extension)

## Step 1: Install Project Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install all required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies listed in `package.json`, including:
- React and React DOM
- Web3.js for blockchain interaction
- Gulp for build automation
- ESLint for code quality
- And other necessary packages

Wait for the installation to complete. You should see a `node_modules` folder created in your project directory.

## Step 2: Install Truffle (Smart Contract Development)

Truffle is a development framework for Ethereum that allows us to write, compile, and deploy smart contracts.

Install Truffle globally:

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
truffle version
```

You should see version information displayed.

## Step 3: Install Ganache (Local Blockchain)

Ganache is a personal blockchain emulator for Ethereum development. It allows us to test our smart contracts and dApps locally without spending real Ether.

### Option A: Install Ganache CLI (Recommended for this tutorial)

```bash
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
ganache-cli --version
```

### Option B: Install Ganache GUI
Alternatively, you can download the GUI version from: https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/

## Step 4: Start the Development Environment

### Terminal 1: Start Ganache (Local Blockchain)

```bash
ganache-cli
```

Ganache will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8545` by default and display:
- 10 test accounts with private keys
- Contract deployment address
- Network ID

**Keep this terminal running** - this is your local blockchain.

### Terminal 2: Build and Run the Extension

In a new terminal, start the development build:

```bash
npm start
```

This will:
- Watch for file changes in the `src/` directory
- Compile React and bundle the extension
- Output the built files to the `dist/` folder
- Display the build process in your terminal

## Step 5: Load the Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Navigate to your project's `dist/` folder and select it
5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list and in the Chrome toolbar

## Key Files to Know

- **manifest.json** - Defines your extension's metadata, permissions, and content scripts
- **src/App.js** - Your main React application component
- **src/context/WalletProvider.js** - Web3 and MetaMask integration
- **gulpfile.js** - Build automation tasks

## Available npm Scripts

```bash
# Start development build with file watching
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests (if configured)
npm test
```

## Common Commands Reference

```bash
# Start local blockchain
ganache-cli

# Compile smart contracts
truffle compile

# Deploy smart contracts to local blockchain
truffle migrate

# Run truffle console connected to local blockchain
truffle console

# Stop Ganache (Ctrl + C in its terminal)
# Stop npm start (Ctrl + C in its terminal)
```

## Next Steps

With everything installed and running:
1. Explore the boilerplate code in the `src/` directory
2. Review the extension manifest in `public/manifest.json`
3. Understand how Web3 is initialized in `src/utils/web3Service.js`
4. Test the extension in Chrome and connect MetaMask
5. Deploy VaultRegistry contract to Ganache
6. Test vault creation and blockchain verification

## Troubleshooting

### npm install fails
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then retry
- Ensure Node.js version is v14 or higher

### Ganache won't start
- Check if port 8545 is already in use
- Try: `ganache-cli -p 8546` to use a different port

### Extension not loading in Chrome
- Ensure you're loading the `dist/` folder, not the project root
- Verify `npm start` completed successfully
- Check Chrome DevTools (F12) for errors
- Reload the extension after making changes

### MetaMask connection issues
- Ensure MetaMask browser extension is installed
- Check that Ganache is running on the correct port
- Verify network is set to `localhost:8545` in MetaMask
